# The two parts of a day-to-day security employee

- Operations: Responding to detections and doing investigation
- Projets: Building new detections and enhancing current ones.

# What is a playbook in cybersecutiry ?

Is a list of how to go through cetain detections, and what it needs to be look through on those incidents.

# What is Security frameworks, controls and posture ?

- Security frameworks are guidelines for building plans to mitigate risk.
- Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce risk.
- Security posture is an organization's ability to secure assets and data and respond to threats.

# What is a SIEM tool ?

They are security of information and event management tools used to automate threat detections and others unusual things that may represent a security risk.

# What is Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) ?

They are software used to detect possible unathourized access to a network or intrusion.

# What is computer forensis ?

# What is the story of the Brain Virus ?

The Brain Virus was the first virus created for IBM computers at January 19, 1986 by Pakistanese. He was virus created with the objective to keep the software of the creators safe, like a way of preventing piracy.
The virus would infect the boot sector of floppy disks (disquete) replacing the original with their own. He consumed resources, making the system slow and because of the replacement of the sector boot it could result in data loss.
One interesting aspect of it was that he would infect other flopp disks making him spread really quickly, as well being hard to detect due to its place of execution (boot sector).
The virus would display a message in the boot sector with the name of the creators who intended to find piracy copies buyers.
