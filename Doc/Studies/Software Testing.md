# Software Testing

## Definition of software testing by Myers

Testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors
The ideia is to interpret tests as good things that exist to find errors and bring value to a program, at the same time, when a test finds a error it should be interpreted as a sucessful test case, not a failing one

## The Black Box strategy

In the Black Box strategy of testing, you see the program your testing as a black box that only receives input data and should retrieve correct output data. The main ideia behind the black box approach is the exaustive input of test data to find errors in a program. It is necessary to think, however, that the "economics" of this type of test are complicated, since creating all possible inputs of a program is barely impossible, so its necessary to test the right things, and try to look in the right places for errors.

## The White Box strategy

In the White Box strategy of testing, you see the insides of the program and can create test cases based on the possible routine paths of the program. At a glance it seems a very ideal way of testing since you will test every possible way data can iteract with the program. The problem comes when the paths are really more than its possible to test, the error don't exist inside the routines or depend on the data that is given.
